# Benjamin's Buttons
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2024

## Theme
We played on the idea of "Benjamin Button", a person who ages in reverse. Every button you collect for Benjamin, the more he "de-ages" and shrinks, and you are able to talk to people further into his past.

## Game Play
The Objective is to get to the end. To do so you'll need to collect all 5 buttons.
Use WASD to move, the mouse to move the camera around, F to interact with NPCs, and left-click to pick between dialouge options.

## Impediments
Our programmer was not feeling well throughout the development, and so a lot of the progress was done in the last 8 hours of the jam. Communication could have been better.

## Implementation
Features include:
 - Fully custom 3D Models and textures
 - Completely original SFX and Music
 - Dialouge for 5 NPCs with multiple options
Assets Used:
 - Exercise 06c - Dialouge
 - Inky
 - GIMP
 - FL Studio
 - VoiceMOD
